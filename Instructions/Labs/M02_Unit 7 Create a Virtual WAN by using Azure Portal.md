# M02-Unit 7 Create a Virtual WAN by using Azure Portal


In this exercise, you will create a Virtual WAN for Contoso.

In this exercise, you will:

+ Task 1: Create a Virtual WAN
+ Task 2: Create a hub by using Azure Portal
+ Task 3: Connect a VNet to the Virtual Hub
+ Task 4: Clean up resources



#### Estimated time: 65 minutes (including ~45 minutes deployment waiting time)

## Task 1: Create a Virtual WAN

1. From a browser, navigate to the Azure portal and sign in with your Azure account.

1. In the portal, type Virtual WAN into the search box and select **Virtual WANs** from the results list.

1. On the Virtual WAN page, select + **Create**. 

1. On the Create WAN page, on the **Basics** tab, fill in the following fields:

   - **Subscription:** Use the existing subscription

   - **Resource group:** ContosoResourceGroup

   - **Resource group location:** Choose a resource location from the dropdown. A WAN is a global resource and does not live in a particular region. However, you must select a region to manage and locate the WAN resource that you create.

   - **Name:** ContosoVirtualWAN

   - **Type:** Standard 

1. When you have finished filling out the fields, select **Review +Create**.

1. Once validation passes, select **Create** to create the Virtual WAN.

1. Wait for deployment to complete (this should take a couple of minutes) and select **Go to resource**.

## Task 2: Create a hub by using Azure Portal

A hub contains gateways for site-to-site, ExpressRoute, or point-to-site functionality. It takes 30 minutes to create the site-to-site VPN gateway in the virtual hub. You must create a Virtual WAN before you can create a hub.

1. On the Virtual WAN page, under **Connectivity**, select **Hubs**.

1. On the Hubs page, select **+New Hub** to open the Create virtual hub page.
   ![Create Virtual Hub, Basics tab.](../media/create-vwan-hub.png)

1. On the Create virtual hub page **Basics** tab, complete the following fields:
   - **Region:** West US
   - **Name:** ContosoVirtualWANHub-WestUS
   - **Hub private address space:** 10.60.0.0/24
   - **Virtual hub capacity:** 2 Routing infrastructure units
   - **Hub routing preference:** VPN

1. Select **Next: Site-to-site**.

1. On the **Site-to-site** tab, complete the following fields:
   - **Do you want to create a Site to site (VPN gateway)?:** Yes
   - The **AS Number** field cannot be edited.
   - **Gateway scale units:** 1 scale unit = 500 Mbps x 2
   - **Routing preference:** leave the default 

1. Select **Review + Create** to validate.

1. Once validation has completed, select **Create** to create the hub. 

1. After 30 minutes, **Refresh** to view the hub on the Hubs page. 

## Task 3: Connect a VNet to the Virtual Hub

1. Locate the Virtual WAN that you created. 

1. In ContosoVirtualWAN, under **Connectivity**, select **Virtual network connections**.

   ![Virtual WAN configuration page with Virtual network connections highlighted.](../media/connect-vnet-to-virtual-hub.png)

1. On ContosoVirtualWAN | Virtual network connections, select **+ Add connection**.

1. In Add connection, use the following information to create the connection.

   - **Connection name:** ContosoVirtualWAN-to-ResearchVNet

   - **Hubs:** ContosoVirtualWANHub-WestUS

   - **Subscription:** no changes

   - **Resource Group:** ContosoResourceGroup

   - **Virtual network:** ResearchVNet

   - **Propagate to none:** Yes

   - **Associate Route Table:** Default

1. Select **Create**.

 

Congratulations! You have created a Virtual WAN and a Virtual WAN Hub and connected the ResearchVNet to the hub.

## Task 4: Clean up resources

   >**Note**: Remember to remove any newly created Azure resources that you no longer use. Removing unused resources ensures you will not see unexpected charges.

1. On the Azure portal, open the **PowerShell** session within the **Cloud Shell** pane.

1. Delete all resource groups you created throughout the labs of this module by running the following command:

   ```powershell
   Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name 'ContosoResourceGroup' -Force -AsJob
   ```

    >**Note**: The command executes asynchronously (as determined by the -AsJob parameter), so while you will be able to run another PowerShell command immediately afterwards within the same PowerShell session, it will take a few minutes before the resource groups are actually removed.
