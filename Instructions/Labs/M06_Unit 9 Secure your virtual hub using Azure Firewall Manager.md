# M06-Unit 9 Secure your virtual hub using Azure Firewall Manager

In this exercise, you will create the spoke virtual network and create a secured virtual hub, then you will connect the hub and spoke virtual networks and route traffic to your hub. Next you will deploy the workload servers, then create a firewall policy and secure your hub, and finally you will test the firewall.

## Create a hub and spoke architecture

In this part of the exercise, you will create the spoke virtual networks and subnets where you will place the workload servers. Then you will create the secured virtual hub and connect the hub and spoke virtual networks.

In this exercise, you will:

+ Task 1: Create two spoke virtual networks and subnets
+ Task 2: Create the secured virtual hub
+ Task 3: Connect the hub and spoke virtual networks
+ Task 4: Deploy the servers
+ Task 5: Create a firewall policy and secure your hub
+ Task 6: Associate the firewall policy
+ Task 7: Route traffic to your hub
+ Task 8: Test the application rule
+ Task 9: Test the network rule
+ Task 10: Clean up resources

#### Estimated time: 60 minutes

## Task 1: Create two spoke virtual networks and subnets

In this task, you will create the two spoke virtual networks each containing a subnet that will host your workload servers. 

1. On the Azure portal home page, in the search box, type **virtual network** and select **Virtual Network** when it appears.
1. Select **Create**.

>**Important Note:** 
>>If the CREATE VIRTUAL NETWORK - TAB menu order is:     
*"Basics* | **Security** | **IP Addressess** | *Tags* | *Review + Create*". Use **Option 1 instructions**.

>>If the CREATE VIRTUAL NETWORK - TAB menu order is:   
*"Basics* | **IP Addressess** | **Security** | *Tags* | *Review + Create*". Scroll down and use **Option 2 instructions**.

#### **Option 1 instructions**

1. On the Create virtual networks pane, on the **Basics** tab, use the information in the following table to create the VNet:

   | **Setting**          | **Value**                        |
   | -------------------- | -------------------------------- |
   | Resource Group       | Create new: Name: **fw-manager-rg**            |

1. On the **IP addresses** blade: In the **existing Address space section**, check that the address space is set to **10.0.0.0/16**

>**Note:** If the Address space is different, then delete and re-create a **10.0.0.0/16** address space.

5. In the Address space section, under **Subnets**, select **Default**.

1. On the **Edit subnet** blade, use the information in the following table to edit the current Subnet (leave others with their default values):

   | **Setting**          | **Value**                        |
   | -------------------- | -------------------------------- |
   | Name | **Workload-01-SN** |
   | Starting address | **10.0.1.0** |

1. On **Private traffic**, select **Send via Azure Firewall**.

1. Select **Save**. 

>Click **OK** for the warning message.

> Once configuration has completed (This can take up to 10 minutes), ensure that under **INTERNET TRAFFIC** and **PRIVATE TRAFFIC**, it says **Secured by Azure Firewall** for both hub-spoke connections.


## Task 8: Test the application rule

In this part of the exercise, you will connect a remote desktop to the firewall public IP address, which is NATed to Srv-Workload-01. You will then use a web browser to test the application rule and connect a remote desktop to Srv-Workload-02 to test the network rule.

In this task you will test the application rule to confirm that it works as expected.

1. Open **Remote Desktop Connection** on your PC.

1. On the **Computer** box, enter the **firewall's public IP address** (e.g., **51.143.226.18**).

1. Select **Show Options**.

1. On the **Username** box, enter **TestUser**.

1. Select **Connect**.

   ![RDP connection to srv-workload-01](../media/rdp-srv-workload-01.png)

1. On the **Enter your credentials** dialog box, log into the **Srv-workload-01** server virtual machine, by using the password you created during the VM deployment.

1. Select **OK**.

1. (If it appears), Select **Yes** on the Network blade.

1. Open Internet Explorer and select **Ok** in the **Set up Internet Explorer 11** dialog box.

1. Browse to **https://www.microsoft.com**.

1. On the **Security Alert** dialog box, select **OK**.

1. Select **Close** on the Internet Explorer security alerts that may pop-up.

1. You should see the Microsoft home page.

    ![RDP session browsing microsoft.com](../media/microsoft-home-page.png)

1. Browse to **https://www.google.com**.

1. On the **Security Alert** dialog box, select **OK**.

1. You should be blocked by the firewall.

    ![RDP session browser blocked on google.com](../media/google-home-page-fail.png)

1. So, you have verified that you can connect to the one allowed FQDN but are blocked from all others.

## Task 9: Test the network rule

In this task you will test the network rule to confirm that it works as expected.

1. While still logged in to the **Srv-workload-01** RDP session, from this remote computer, open **Remote Desktop Connection**.

1. On the **Computer** box, enter the **private IP address** of **Srv-workload-02** (e.g., **10.1.1.4**).

1. On the **Enter your credentials** dialog box, log in to the **Srv-workload-02** server by using the username **TestUser**, and the password you provided during the deployment.

1. Select **OK**.

1. (If it appears), Select **Yes** on the Network blade.

   ![RDP session from srv-workload-01 to another RDP session on srv-workload-02](../media/rdp-srv-workload-02-from-srv-workload-01.png)

1. So, now you have verified that the firewall network rule is working, as you have connected a remote desktop from one server to another server located in another virtual network.

1. Close both RDP sessions to disconnect them.


## Task 10: Clean up resources 

>**Note**: Remember to remove any newly created Azure resources that you no longer use. Removing unused resources ensures you will not see unexpected charges.

1. On the Azure portal, open the **PowerShell** session within the **Cloud Shell** pane.

1. Delete all resource groups you created throughout the labs of this module by running the following command:

   ```powershell
   Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name 'fw-manager-rg' -Force -AsJob
   ```

    >**Note**: The command executes asynchronously (as determined by the -AsJob parameter), so while you will be able to run another PowerShell command immediately afterwards within the same PowerShell session, it will take a few minutes before the resource groups are actually removed.
