# M05-Unit 6 Create a Front Door for a highly available web application using the Azure portal

 

In this exercise, you will set up an Azure Front Door configuration that pools two instances of a web application that runs in different Azure regions. This configuration directs traffic to the nearest site that runs the application. Azure Front Door continuously monitors the web application. You will demonstrate automatic failover to the next available site when the nearest site is unavailable. The network configuration is shown in the following diagram:

In this exercise, you will:

+ Task 1: Create two instances of a web app
+ Task 2: Create a Front Door for your application
+ Task 3: View Azure Front Door in action
+ Task 4: Clean up resources


#### Estimated time: 30 minutes

## Task 1: Create two instances of a web app

This exercise requires two instances of a web application that run in different Azure regions. Both the web application instances run in Active/Active mode, so either one can take traffic. This configuration differs from an Active/Stand-By configuration, where one acts as a failover.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal at [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. On the Azure home page, using the global search type **WebApp** and select **App Services** under services.

1. Select **+ Create** to create a Web App.

## Task 2: Create a Front Door for your application

Configure Azure Front Door to direct user traffic based on lowest latency between the two web apps servers. To begin, add a frontend host for Azure Front Door.

1. On any Azure Portal page, in **Search resources, services and docs (G+/)**, Search for Front Door and CDN profiles, and then select **Front Door and CDN profiles**.

1. Select **Create front door and CDN profiles**. On the Compare offerings page, select **Quick create**. Then select **Continue to create a Front Door**.

1. On the Basics tab, enter or select the following information.


   | **Setting**             | **Value**                                    |
   | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
   | Subscription            | Select your subscription.                    |
   | Resource group          | Select **ContosoResourceGroup**                  |
   | Resource group location | Accept default setting                       |
   | Name                    | Enter a unique name in this subscription like **FrontDoor(yourinitials)**   |
   | Tier                    | **Standard**   |
   | Endpoint Name           | **FDendpoint**   |
   | Origin Type             | **App Service**  | 
   | Origin host name        | Select **WebAppContoso-1xx** |
   

1. Select **Review and Create**, and then select **Create**.

1. Wait for the resource to deploy, and then select **Go to resource**.

1. On the **Front Door** blade, in the menu, under  **Settings**: Select **Origin Groups**.

1. Select **default-origin-group** from the list. 

1. On the **Update origin group** blade: Select **Add an origin**.

1. Add the second Web App using the following table details. Leave other default settings

   | **Setting**             | **Value**                                    |
   | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
   | Name                    |  **WebAppContoso-2**  |
   | Origin Type             | **App Service**  | 
   | host name        | Select **WebAppContoso-2xx** |

1. Click **Add**

1. Click **Update**

>Wait for deployment to complete.

## Task 3: View Azure Front Door in action

Once you create a Front Door, it takes a few minutes for the configuration to be deployed globally. Once complete, access the frontend host you created. 

1. On the Front Door resource in the Overview blade, locate the endpoint hostname that is created for your endpoint. This should be fdendpoint followed by a hyphen and a random string. For example, **fdendpoint-fxa8c8hddhhgcrb9.z01.azurefd.net**. **Copy** this FQDN.

1. In a new browser tab, navigate to the Front Door endpoint FQDN. The default App Service page will be displayed.
   ![Browser showing App Service information page](../media/app-service-info-page.png)

1. To test instant global failover in action, try the following steps:

1. Switch to the Azure portal, search for and select **App services**. 

1. Select one of your web apps, then select **Stop**, and then select **Yes** to verify.

   ![Azure Portal showing stopped Web App](../media/stop-web-app.png)

1. Switch back to your browser and select Refresh. You should see the same information page.

**There may be a delay while the web app stops. If you get an error page in your browser, refresh the page**.

1. Switch back to the Azure Portal, locate the other web app, and stop it.

1. Switch back to your browser and select Refresh. This time, you should see an error message.

   Congratulations! You have configured and tested an Azure Front Door.
   

## Task 4: Clean up resources
   
   >**Note**: Remember to remove any newly created Azure resources that you no longer use. Removing unused resources ensures you will not see unexpected charges.

1. On the Azure portal, open the **PowerShell** session within the **Cloud Shell** pane.

1. Delete all resource groups you created throughout the labs of this module by running the following command:

   ```powershell

   Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name 'ContosoResourceGroup' -Force -AsJob

   ```

    >**Note**: The command executes asynchronously (as determined by the -AsJob parameter), so while you will be able to run another PowerShell command immediately afterwards within the same PowerShell session, it will take a few minutes before the resource groups are actually removed.
